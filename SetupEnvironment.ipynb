    "# Choosing between online and a local environment\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many options to work with Jupyter Notebooks and Python. The key choice is, if you want to use an online service (no need to install software, easy to reset to original state, but some a limited or slow in free version) or if you prefer to install the software locally on your computer (full control, deeper understanding of inner workings, no cost or performance limits other that computing power of your machine).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use one of the many online offerings such as:\n",
    "- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) - service from Google, has a free tier, but requires a Google account\n",
    "- [MyBinder](mybinder.org) - an online service for running notebooks that are available from a public code repository like github\n",
    "- [Deepnote](deepnote.com) - offering that focuses on its collaboration featureset\n",
    "- [Kaggle Kernels](kaggle.com) - the popular community hosting machine learning competitions is owned by Google and provides resources to directly run notebooks.\n",
    "- [CoCalc](cocalc.com) - opensource solution service offering by a company calls SageMath, look and feel from the original Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "- [JupyterLite](https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab) - JupyterLite is an online notebook that runs entirely in the web browser und thus can be a little slow and is limited since many packages are simply not available\n",
    "There are many more, but these are - to my knowledge - the most popular ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, should you instead opt to install the environment on your local computer, this guide is for you.\n",
    "\n",

    "You first need to set up a Python environment (if you do not have done so already). The easiest way to do this is by installing [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), which will install Python as well as a set of commonly used packages. We will be using Python 3, so be sure to install the right version. Always install a 64-bit installer (if your machine supports it), and we recommend using Python 3.10 or later.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are completely new to Python, we recommend reading the [Python Data Science Handbook](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook) or taking an introductory online course, such as the [Definite Guide to Python](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming), the [Whirlwind Tour of Python](https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython), or [this Python Course](https://www.python-course.eu/).

    "For those who have a laptop with Apple Silicon, [this guide may be useful](https://medium.com/mlearning-ai/install-tensorflow-on-mac-m1-m2-with-gpu-support-c404c6cfb580) to install a TensorFlow version that will effectively use the GPUs. However, installing the latest version of tensorflow-macos doesn't always work reliably and you may have to downgrade to an older version. Also for most of the course content, you don't need the full processing power, so you can probably skip this for now.\n",
